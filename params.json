{"name":"Inchat","tagline":"Chat program through the EMS Server from TIBCO","body":"#  What is InChat\r\nIn chat is basicly a program that connects to a local/remote [EMS server.](http://www.tibco.com/products/automation/enterprise-messaging/enterprise-message-service) \r\n\r\n* [Setup](#setup)\r\n  * [Server Side](#server-side)\r\n  * [Client Side](#client-side)\r\n    * [Compiling From Source](#compiling-from-source)\r\n    * [Downloading the RPM ](#downloading-the-rpm)\r\n* [Config File](#config-file)\r\n* [Commando's](#commandos)\r\n    \r\n##  Setup\r\nThere are (like almost every programs) actions to be done to be actually able to run the program\r\n### Server Side\r\nYou need a tibco ems server running on one of your servers. Use tibemsadmin or any other Tibco EMS Administration Tool to login to the server.\r\n\r\nMake a new topic called InChat.> with the commando:\r\n>create topic InChat.>\r\n\r\nThe greater then symbol that users can generate dynamic rooms like InChat.Rooms.Public.Main2. If this topic isn't created nobody will be able to make new room.\r\n\r\nYou'll also need a tibco user called admin with the password admin for login from the program. You can use your own users but you'll have to change the source code for that.\r\n\r\n### Client Side\r\n\r\n#### Compiling from source\r\nDownload the latest release version from this program.\r\n\r\nUnzip the downloaded file and add (LOCATION TO GIT)/lib/linux/64 to your PATH.\r\n\r\nRun make (If it doesn't compile send me a message)\r\n#### Downloading the RPM \r\n(Not Done Yet)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Config File\r\nAdded in the RPM(Not Done Yet) and release versions is a InChat.cfg. This config file contains three basic settings\r\n* url  : which is the url on which the EMS Server is\r\n* port : which is the port number on which the EMS Server runs. (Default number is 7222)\r\n* topic: the room you want to start in. (Default topic adress is InChat.Rooms.Public.Main)\r\n\r\nIf you want to enter a private room you will have to change the topic to InChat.Rooms.Private. (PRIVATE_ROOM_NAME)\r\nYou have to change to topic here because the /changeRoom commando only transfers you to Public rooms.\r\n\r\n## Commando's\r\nThere are several different basic commandos in InChat, these are all excecuted with /(COMMANDO) (PARAMETERS):\r\n* changeUsername / cu (NAME): This commando lets you change username.\r\n* exit                      : exits the program\r\n* help                      : show the help menu with all the commandos and parameters\r\n* changeRoom (ROOM NAME)    : lets you change rooms. Works only with public rooms. If you want to switch to a private room, you'll have to change the InChat.cfg file and restart the program\r\n* sendFile                  :\r\n* receiveFile               :\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
