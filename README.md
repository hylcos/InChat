##  Setup
There are (like almost every programs) actions to be done to be actually able to run the program
### Server Side
You need a tibco ems server running on one of your servers. Use tibemsadmin or any other Tibco EMS Administration Tool to login to the server.

Make a new topic called InChat.> with the commando:
>create topic InChat.>

The greater then symbol that users can generate dynamic rooms like InChat.Rooms.Public.Main2. If this topic isn't created nobody will be able to make new room.

You'll also need a tibco user called admin with the password admin for login from the program. You can use your own users but you'll have to change the source code for that.

## Config File
Added in the RPM(Not Done Yet) and release versions is a InChat.cfg. This config file contains three basic settings
* url  : which is the url on which the EMS Server is
* port : which is the port number on which the EMS Server runs. (Default number is 7222)
* topic: the room you want to start in. (Default topic adress is InChat.Rooms.Public.Main)

If you want to enter a private room you will have to change the topic to InChat.Rooms.Private. (PRIVATE_ROOM_NAME)
You have to change to topic here because the /changeRoom commando only transfers you to Public rooms.

## Commando's
There are several different basic commandos in InChat, these are all excecuted with /(COMMANDO) (PARAMETERS):
* changeUsername / cu (NAME): This commando lets you change username.
* exit                      : exits the program
* help                      : show the help menu with all the commandos and parameters
* changeRoom (ROOM NAME)    : lets you change rooms. Works only with public rooms. If you want to switch to a private room, you'll have to change the InChat.cfg file and restart the program
* sendFile                  :
* receiveFile               :
* users                     :
